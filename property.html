    <h1>Property Laws</h1><!--1..-->
   
    <p>Property tax is a levy imposed by the local government on property owners within its jurisdiction. It is a major source of revenue for municipal bodies and is used to fund various civic amenities and services, such as road maintenance, garbage collection, and street lighting. Here's a detailed description of property tax in India</p>
    <div class="law-container">
      <div class="law-item">
        <h2 class="law-title"> 1. Ownership:</h2>
        <p class="law-explanation"> 
           Indian law recognizes two types of property ownership - ancestral property and self-acquired property. 
           <br>Ancestral property refers to property inherited up to four generations of male lineage and should be equally divided among legal heirs. Self-acquired property is one that a person acquires through their own efforts or resources, and they have the right to dispose of it as they wish.
          </p>

      <div class="law-item">
        <h2 class="law-title">2. Succession:</h2>
        <p class="law-explanation">
            In case of intestate succession (when a person dies without a will), the property is divided among legal heirs according to the personal laws applicable to them (Hindu Succession Act for Hindus, Indian Succession Act for Christians, etc.).
            <br>- Making a will can help in specifying how one's property should be distributed after death.

      <div class="law-item">
        <h2 class="law-title">3. Title Verification:</h2>
        <p class="law-explanation"> Before buying a property, it's crucial to verify the title deed and ensure that the seller has the legal right to sell the property. This can help avoid legal disputes later.
